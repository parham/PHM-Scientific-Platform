# PHM Scientific Platform

*** The project is developed in 2014 ***
The project contains various implemented algorithms in machine learning, soft computing, face analysis, micro-motion detection and etc. So I decided to clean up the codes for others who may find it useful. 

## Reference:
In case of using this library , please cite one or more of the following papers:

* Nooralishahi, P., Seera, M., & Loo, C. K. (2017). Online semi-supervised multi-channel time series classifier based on growing neural gas. Neural Computing and Applications, 28(11), 3491-3505.
* Nooralishahi, P., Loo, C. K., & Seera, M. (2018). Semi-supervised topo-Bayesian ARTMAP for noisy data. Applied Soft Computing, 62, 134-147.
* Nooralishahi, P., Loo, C. K., & Shiung, L. W. (2019). Robust remote heart rate estimation from multiple asynchronous noisy channels using autoregressive model with Kalman filter. Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 47, 366-379.

## Build Requirements:

* Apache common-pipeline:
The maven repository for this library is not available anymore. So you can download the code from:

https://github.com/nuttycom/commons-pipeline

Then, run following commands:

```
mvn package
mvn install
```
